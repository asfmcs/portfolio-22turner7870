    <h3><br> Downtown Cancun<br><br></h3>
    <p><center> Downtown is one of the many places in Cancun most tourists seem to skip in exchange for beach visits or other activities. But if you want a more authentic feel of Cancun away from the Hotel Zone (which sometimes feels like the Vegas strip) then you’ll want to head downtown. Downtown is home to a plethora of activities and restaurants offering a look into local life, a trip here is one of the better things to do in Cancun for sure. Cancun’s top market offers a colorful maze of souvenir stands and jewelry shops that cover a full city block, with several small restaurants in the center so you can grab a quick lunch during a day of shopping. Market 28 is a fun way to get the real Mexican market experience. Downtown’s main mall is where you’ll find most locals on any given weekend. Malecon Americas has a lovely and modern open-air atmosphere where you can grab an ice cream, browse beautiful department stores, and enjoy a meal at a variety of restaurants. Malecon Americas sits right across the avenue from Malecon Tajamar, so you can easily see both attractions in one outing. </p></center>
