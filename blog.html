    <h3 id="HTML"><center>HTML</center></h3>
    <p><div class="Courier"> Over the past few weeks in computers class we have been taking short classes in Khan Academy about both CSS and HTML. We have also done 2 projects which contain most of the things that we learned. In HTML I have learned to do things like tables, headings, paragraphs, center text, classes, external and internal links and much more. Some of these are more hard to remember than others, fore example, it is really hard to remember all of the different tags to make a table becuase there are a lot. But to make a paragraph it is easy due to the fact that there is only tag which is easy to remember. Something that I do when I forget what all of the tags is go to the W3 schools becuase it is a realy helfpul site where you can find how to do almost anything in HTML and once I find what I need I just copy it over to what I am doing, that way I find what I am looking for and see what it is that I am copying so I will remember. <br> <br>
    Learning all of these things was really fun to do, I learned a lot of things that I didn't think I was going to learn. Like how to make tables, different sizes of text and many other things. It was also really fun becuase it was a small step to learning how to code and I think that coding is going to be a very important thing and skill in the future and it is somehing that everyone needs to know. Throughout the unit I also liked that we had some projects and there were guidelines but we also had a lot of freedom in those projects and we could design and do some of the things our way. Overall I think that this unit has been very very fun and useful as well as important to the learning of everyone in the class.</p>

    <p> As well as HTML I have learned a lot about CSS, I learned that CSS descibes all of the things put in the HTML. For example, if I typed in a paragraph in HTML, I can edit the font, size, or even color of that paragraph. CSS is really useful when you want to make the webpage seem more playful and attractive. If you don't add any CSS the website will all be black and white, with the default font and it will not catch anyones eye, no one will want to look at it. That is why CSS is as or even more important than HTML. I have learned things like, changing the background color of the website, how to center text, to change fonts, highlight text, change size, or shape of pictures, and many other things. It has been really fun learning all of these things, especially becuase it lets me do to website more how I want it, instead of only being able to have the power of what to write I can now still have the power to write what I want but to have the page and text the way that I want it.<br><br>
    Learning CSS was somewhat hard, the reason why it was sort of hard was becuase I had to remember what you had to put when you were making a class or wanted to edit a certain part of the text or the pictures. But some parts were easier, like changing the background color for a certain heading or the paragraphs. Whenever I had a problem remembering what I had to put, I had the same solution than HTML, I would go to w3schools and find what I needed to find, once I found it I would see what it was that I had to write and copy it over to my repl.it and have it there for whenever I needed it. All in all this unit has been really helpfull to my learning as well as really fun and important for the future.
